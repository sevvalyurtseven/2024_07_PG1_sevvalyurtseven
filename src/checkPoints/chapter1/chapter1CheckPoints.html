    <button class="accordion">1.10 What language does the CPU understand?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p><span>Answer:</span> The CPU understands machine language, which is composed of binary code (0s and 1s).</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">1.11 What is an assembly language?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p><span>Answer:</span> Assembly language is a low-level programming language that is closely related to machine language but is more readable by humans. It uses symbolic code and is specific to a computer's architecture.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">1.12 What is an assembler?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p><span>Answer:</span> An assembler is a program that translates assembly language code into machine code so that it can be executed by the CPU.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">1.13 What is a high-level programming language?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p><span>Answer:</span> A high-level programming language is a language that is more abstract and closer to human languages, making it easier to read and write. It is independent of the hardware and is translated into machine code by a compiler or interpreter.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">1.14 What is a source program?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p><span>Answer:</span> A source program is the original code written by a programmer in a high-level programming language before it is compiled or interpreted.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">1.15 What is an interpreter?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p><span>Answer:</span> An interpreter is a program that directly executes the instructions in a source program without compiling it into machine code first, interpreting the code line by line.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">1.16 What is a compiler?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p><span>Answer:</span> A compiler is a program that translates code written in a high-level programming language into machine code, producing an executable file that can be run by the CPU.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">1.17 What is the difference between an interpreted language and a compiled language?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p><span>Answer:</span> The difference lies in how the code is executed. In an interpreted language, the code is executed line by line by an interpreter. In a compiled language, the entire program is first compiled into machine code, and then the resulting executable file is run.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">1.18 What is an operating system? List some popular operating systems.</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p><span>Answer:</span> An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources, and provides services for computer programs. Popular operating systems include Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">1.19 What are the major responsibilities of an operating system?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p><span>Answer:</span> The major responsibilities include process management, memory management, file system management, device management, security and access control, and providing a user interface.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">1.20 What are multiprogramming, multithreading, and multiprocessing?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p><span>Answer:</span> Multiprogramming is the ability of an OS to run multiple programs simultaneously by keeping several in memory. Multithreading is the ability of a CPU to execute multiple threads concurrently within a single process. Multiprocessing is the use of two or more CPUs within a computer system to run multiple processes simultaneously.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">1.21 Who invented Java? Which company owns Java now?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p><span>Answer:</span> Java was invented by James Gosling in 1995 while he was working at Sun Microsystems. Java is now owned by Oracle Corporation.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">1.22 What is a Java applet?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p><span>Answer:</span> A Java applet is a small Java program that can be embedded in a web page and run in a web browser. However, due to security issues, applets are now largely obsolete.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">1.23 What programming language does Android use?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p><span>Answer:</span> Android primarily uses Java, and more recently, Kotlin is also officially supported for Android development.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">1.24 What is the Java language specification?</button>

    <div class="panel">
        <p><span>Answer:</span> NetBeans and Eclipse are not languages; they are Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) that support Java development. They provide tools and features to write, debug, and manage Java code.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">1.28 What is a keyword? List some Java keywords.</button>
    <div class="panel">

    <button class="accordion">1.41 Reformat the following program according to the programming style and documentation guidelines. Use the end-of-line brace style:</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <h4>Question:</h4>
        <pre><code>
public class Test {
    // Main method
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        /** Display output */
        System.out.println("Welcome to Java");
    }

    <button class="accordion">1.42 What are syntax errors (compile errors), runtime errors, and logic errors?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p><span>Answer:</span> Syntax errors are errors in the code that violate the rules of the programming language and prevent the code from compiling. Runtime errors are errors that occur while the program is running, causing it to crash. Logic errors are errors in the program's logic that cause it to produce incorrect results, even though it compiles and runs.</p>
    </div>
