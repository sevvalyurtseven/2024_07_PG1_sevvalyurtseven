    <button class="accordion">1.10 What language does the CPU understand?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p><span>Answer:</span> The CPU understands machine language, which is composed of binary code (0s and 1s).</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">1.11 What is an assembly language?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p><span>Answer:</span> Assembly language is a low-level programming language that is closely related to machine language but is more readable by humans. It uses symbolic code and is specific to a computer's architecture.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">1.12 What is an assembler?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p><span>Answer:</span> An assembler is a program that translates assembly language code into machine code so that it can be executed by the CPU.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">1.13 What is a high-level programming language?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p><span>Answer:</span> A high-level programming language is a programming language that is more abstract and closer to human languages, making it easier to read and write. It is independent of the computer's hardware and needs to be compiled or interpreted into machine code.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">1.14 What is a source program?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p><span>Answer:</span> A source program is the original code written by a programmer in a high-level programming language before it is compiled or interpreted into machine code.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">1.15 What is an interpreter?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p><span>Answer:</span> An interpreter is a program that directly executes the instructions written in a programming language without requiring them to be compiled into machine code. It reads the source code line by line, interprets it, and performs the specified actions immediately.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">1.16 What is a compiler?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p><span>Answer:</span> A compiler is a program that translates code written in a high-level programming language into machine code, which the CPU can execute. The entire program is compiled at once, and an executable file is generated, which can be run independently.
        </p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">1.17 What is the difference between an interpreted language and a compiled language?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p><span>Answer:</span> The main difference between an interpreted language and a compiled language lies in how the code is executed: <br/><br/>

            <span>Interpreted Language:</span> The code is executed line by line by an interpreter, and it doesn't need to be compiled into machine code before execution. Examples include Python and JavaScript.<br/><br/>

            <span>Compiled Language:</span> The code is first compiled into machine code by a compiler, resulting in an executable file. This file can be run directly by the CPU. Examples include C, C++, and Java.

            <br/><br/>In general, compiled languages tend to be faster since the translation into machine code happens before execution, whereas interpreted languages offer more flexibility and ease of debugging but might be slower due to the on-the-fly interpretation.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">1.18 What is an operating system? List some popular operating systems.</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p><span>Answer:</span> An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs. The OS acts as an intermediary between users and the computer hardware, enabling user interaction with the system.

            <br/><br/> <span>Some popular operating systems include:</span>

            <br/><span>1.</span> Windows
            <br/><span>2.</span> macOS
            <br/><span>3.</span> Linux (e.g., Ubuntu, Fedora)
            <br/><span>4.</span> Android
            <br/><span>5.</span> iOS</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">1.19 What are the major responsibilities of an operating system?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p><span>Answer:</span> The major responsibilities of an operating system include:<br/><br/>

            <span>1. Process Management:</span> Managing the creation, scheduling, and termination of processes.<br/><br/>
            <span>2. Memory Management:</span> Handling and allocating memory to processes, ensuring efficient use of system memory.<br/><br/>
            <span>3. File System Management:</span> Managing files and directories, including file creation, deletion, and access control.<br/><br/>
            <span>4. Device Management:</span> Controlling and interfacing with input/output devices, ensuring proper communication between hardware and software.<br/><br/>
            <span>5. Security and Access Control:</span> Protecting the system from unauthorized access, managing user permissions, and ensuring data security.<br/><br/>
            <span>6. User Interface:</span> Providing a user interface (e.g., command-line interface, graphical user interface) for interacting with the system.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">1.20 What are multiprogramming, multithreading, and multiprocessing?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p><span>Answer:</span><br/>
            <span>Multiprogramming:</span> Multiprogramming refers to the ability of an operating system to run multiple programs simultaneously by keeping several programs in memory at the same time. The OS switches between them, optimizing CPU usage and minimizing idle time.<br/><br/>

            <span>Multithreading:</span> Multithreading is the ability of a CPU (or a single process) to execute multiple threads concurrently. Each thread represents a separate path of execution within a program, allowing tasks to be performed simultaneously within a single application.<br/><br/>

            <span>Multiprocessing:</span> Multiprocessing refers to the use of two or more CPUs within a single computer system. This allows multiple processes to run simultaneously on different processors, improving system performance and enabling parallel processing.<br/><br/>

            These concepts are essential for optimizing system performance and ensuring efficient use of hardware resources.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">1.21 Who invented Java? Which company owns Java now?</button>
    <div class="panel">

    </div>

    <button class="accordion">1.22 What is a Java applet?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p><span>Answer:</span> A Java applet is a small application written in Java that can be embedded in a web page and run in a web browser. However, due to security issues and modern web development trends, Java applets are now largely obsolete.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">1.23 What programming language does Android use?</button>
