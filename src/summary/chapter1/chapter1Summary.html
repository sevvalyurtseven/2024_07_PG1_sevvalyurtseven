<h1>Chapter 1 Summary</h1>
<ul>
    <li>A computer is an electronic device that stores and processes data.</li>
    <li>A computer includes both hardware and software.</li>
    <li>Hardware is the physical aspect of the computer that can be touched.</li>
    <li>Computer programs, known as software, are the invisible instructions that control the hardware and make it perform tasks.</li>
    <li>Computer programming is the writing of instructions (i.e., code) for computers to perform.</li>
    <li>The central processing unit (CPU) is a computer’s brain. It retrieves instructions from memory and executes them.</li>
    <li>Computers use zeros and ones because digital devices have two stable states, referred to by convention as zero and one.</li>
    <li>A bit is a binary digit 0 or 1.</li>
    <li>A byte is a sequence of 8 bits.</li>
    <li>A kilobyte is about 1,000 bytes, a megabyte about 1 million bytes, a gigabyte about 1 billion bytes, and a terabyte about 1,000 gigabytes.</li>
    <li>Memory stores data and program instructions for the CPU to execute.</li>
    <li>A memory unit is an ordered sequence of bytes.</li>
    <li>Memory is volatile, because information is lost when the power is turned off.</li>
    <li>Programs and data are permanently stored on storage devices and are moved to memory when the computer actually uses them.</li>
    <li>The machine language is a set of primitive instructions built into every computer.</li>
    <li>Assembly language is a low-level programming language in which a mnemonic is used to represent each machine-language instruction.</li>
    <li>High-level languages are English-like and easy to learn and program.</li>
    <li>A program written in a high-level language is called a source program.</li>
    <li>A compiler is a software program that translates the source program into a machine-language program.</li>
    <li>The operating system (OS) is a program that manages and controls a computer’s activities.</li>
    <li>Java is platform independent, meaning that you can write a program once and run it on any computer.</li>
    <li>Java programs can be embedded in HTML pages and downloaded by Web browsers to bring live animation and interaction to Web clients.</li>
    <li>The Java source file name must match the public class name in the program. Java source code files must end with the .java extension.</li>
    <li>Every class is compiled into a separate bytecode file that has the same name as the class and ends with the .class extension.</li>
    <li>To compile a Java source-code file from the command line, use the javac command.</li>
    <li>To run a Java class from the command line, use the java command.</li>
    <li>Every Java program is a set of class definitions. The keyword class introduces a class definition. The contents of the class are included in a block.</li>
    <li>A block begins with an opening brace ({) and ends with a closing brace (}).</li>
    <li>Methods are contained in a class. To run a Java program, the program must have a main method. The main method is the entry point where the program starts when it is executed.</li>
    <li>Every statement in Java ends with a semicolon (;), known as the statement terminator.</li>
    <li>Reserved words, or keywords, have a specific meaning to the compiler and cannot be used for other purposes in the program.</li>
    <li>In Java, comments are preceded by two slashes (//) on a line, called a line comment, or enclosed between /* and */ on one or several lines, called a block comment or paragraph comment. Comments are ignored by the compiler.</li>
    <li>Java source programs are case sensitive.</li>
    <li>Programming errors can be categorized into three types: syntax errors, runtime errors, and logic errors. Errors reported by a compiler are called syntax errors or compile errors. Runtime errors are errors that cause a program to terminate abnormally. Logic errors occur when a program does not perform the way it was intended to.</li>
