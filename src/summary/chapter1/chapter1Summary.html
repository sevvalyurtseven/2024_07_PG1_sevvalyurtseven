<h1>Chapter 1 Summary</h1>
<h2>Introduction To Computers, Programs and Java</h2>
<ul>
    <li><span>A computer</span> is an electronic device that stores and processes data.</li>
    <li><span>A computer</span> includes both <span>hardware</span> and <span>software</span>.</li>
    <li><span>Hardware</span> is the physical aspect of the computer that can be touched.</li>
    <li><span>Computer programs</span>, known as <span>software</span>, are the invisible instructions that control the hardware and make it perform tasks.</li>
    <li><span>Computer programming</span> is the writing of instructions (i.e., code) for computers to perform.</li>
    <li>The <span>central processing unit (CPU)</span> is a computer’s brain. It retrieves instructions from memory and executes them.</li>
    <li><span>Computers</span> use <span>zeros and ones</span> because digital devices have two stable states, referred to by convention as zero and one.</li>
    <li>A <span>bit</span> is a binary digit 0 or 1.</li>
    <li>A <span>byte</span> is a sequence of 8 bits.</li>
    <li>A <span>kilobyte</span> is about 1,000 bytes, a <span>megabyte</span> about 1 million bytes, a <span>gigabyte</span> about 1 billion bytes, and a <span>terabyte</span> about 1,000 gigabytes.</li>
    <li><span>Memory</span> stores data and program instructions for the CPU to execute.</li>
    <li>A <span>memory unit</span> is an ordered sequence of bytes.</li>
    <li><span>Memory</span> is volatile, because information is lost when the power is turned off.</li>
    <li>Programs and data are permanently stored on <span>storage devices</span> and are moved to memory when the computer actually uses them.</li>
    <li>The <span>machine language</span> is a set of primitive instructions built into every computer.</li>
    <li><span>Assembly language</span> is a low-level programming language in which a mnemonic is used to represent each machine-language instruction.</li>
    <li><span>High-level languages</span> are English-like and easy to learn and program.</li>
    <li>A program written in a high-level language is called a <span>source program</span>.</li>
    <li>A <span>compiler</span> is a software program that translates the source program into a machine-language program.</li>
    <li>The <span>operating system (OS)</span> is a program that manages and controls a computer’s activities.</li>
    <li><span>Java</span> is <span>platform independent</span>, meaning that you can write a program once and run it on any computer.</li>
    <li><span>Java programs</span> can be embedded in HTML pages and downloaded by Web browsers to bring live animation and interaction to Web clients.</li>
    <li>The <span>Java source file name</span> must match the public class name in the program. Java source code files must end with the <span>.java</span> extension.</li>
    <li>Every class is compiled into a separate <span>bytecode file</span> that has the same name as the class and ends with the <span>.class</span> extension.</li>
    <li>To compile a Java source-code file from the command line, use the <span>javac</span> command.</li>
    <li>To run a Java class from the command line, use the <span>java</span> command.</li>
    <li>Every <span>Java program</span> is a set of class definitions. The keyword <span>class</span> introduces a class definition. The contents of the class are included in a block.</li>
    <li>A <span>block</span> begins with an opening brace (<span>{</span>) and ends with a closing brace (<span>}</span>).</li>
    <li><span>Methods</span> are contained in a class. To run a <span>Java program</span>, the program must have a <span>main method</span>. The <span>main method</span> is the entry point where the program starts when it is executed.</li>
    <li>Every statement in Java ends with a <span>semicolon (;)</span>, known as the <span>statement terminator</span>.</li>
    <li><span>Reserved words</span>, or <span>keywords</span>, have a specific meaning to the compiler and cannot be used for other purposes in the program.</li>
    <li>In Java, <span>comments</span> are preceded by two slashes (<span>//</span>) on a line, called a <span>line comment</span>, or enclosed between <span>/*</span> and <span>*/</span> on one or several lines, called a <span>block comment</span> or <span>paragraph comment</span>. Comments are ignored by the compiler.</li>
    <li><span>Java source programs</span> are <span>case sensitive</span>.</li>
    <li><span>Programming errors</span> can be categorized into three types: <span>syntax errors</span>, <span>runtime errors</span>, and <span>logic errors</span>. Errors reported by a compiler are called <span>syntax errors</span> or <span>compile errors</span>. <span>Runtime errors</span> are errors that cause a program to terminate abnormally. <span>Logic errors</span> occur when a program does not perform the way it was intended to.</li>
