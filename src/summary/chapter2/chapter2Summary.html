<h1>Chapter 2 Summary</h1>
<h2>Elementary Programming</h2>
<ul>
    <li><span>Identifiers</span> are names for naming elements such as <span>variables</span>, <span>constants</span>, <span>methods</span>, <span>classes</span>, <span>packages</span> in a program.</li>
    <li>An <span>identifier</span> is a sequence of characters that consists of letters, digits, underscores (_), and dollar signs ($). An <span>identifier</span> must start with a letter or an underscore. It cannot start with a digit. An <span>identifier</span> cannot be a <span>reserved word</span>. An <span>identifier</span> can be of any length.</li>
    <li><span>Variables</span> are used to store data in a program. To declare a variable is to tell the compiler what type of data a variable can hold.</li>
    <li>There are two types of <span>import</span> statements: <span>specific import</span> and <span>wildcard import</span>. The <span>specific import</span> specifies a single class in the import statement; the <span>wildcard import</span> imports all the classes in a package.</li>
    <li>In Java, the equal sign (<span>=</span>) is used as the <span>assignment operator</span>.</li>
    <li>A <span>variable</span> declared in a method must be assigned a value before it can be used.</li>
    <li>A <span>named constant</span> (or simply a <span>constant</span>) represents permanent data that never changes.</li>
    <li>A <span>named constant</span> is declared by using the keyword <span>final</span>.</li>
    <li>Java provides four <span>integer types</span> (<span>byte</span>, <span>short</span>, <span>int</span>, and <span>long</span>) that represent integers of four different sizes.</li>
    <li>Java provides two <span>floating-point types</span> (<span>float</span> and <span>double</span>) that represent floating-point numbers of two different precisions.</li>
    <li>Java provides operators that perform <span>numeric operations</span>: <span>+ (addition)</span>, <span>– (subtraction)</span>, <span>* (multiplication)</span>, <span>/ (division)</span>, and <span>% (remainder)</span>.</li>
    <li><span>Integer arithmetic</span> (<span>/</span>) yields an <span>integer result</span>.</li>
    <li>The <span>numeric operators</span> in a Java expression are applied the same way as in an <span>arithmetic expression</span>.</li>
    <li>Java provides the <span>augmented assignment operators</span> <span>+= (addition assignment)</span>, <span>–= (subtraction assignment)</span>, <span>*= (multiplication assignment)</span>, <span>/= (division assignment)</span>, and <span>%= (remainder assignment)</span>.</li>
    <li>The <span>increment operator</span> (<span>++</span>) and the <span>decrement operator</span> (<span>––</span>) increment or decrement a variable by 1.</li>
    <li>When evaluating an expression with values of mixed types, Java automatically converts the operands to appropriate types.</li>
    <li>You can explicitly convert a value from one type to another using the <span>(type)value</span> notation.</li>
    <li>Casting a variable of a type with a small range to a variable of a type with a larger range is known as <span>widening a type</span>.</li>
    <li>Casting a variable of a type with a large range to a variable of a type with a smaller range is known as <span>narrowing a type</span>.</li>
    <li><span>Widening a type</span> can be performed automatically without explicit casting. <span>Narrowing a type</span> must be performed explicitly.</li>
    <li>In computer science, midnight of <span>January 1, 1970</span>, is known as the <span>UNIX epoch</span>.</li>
