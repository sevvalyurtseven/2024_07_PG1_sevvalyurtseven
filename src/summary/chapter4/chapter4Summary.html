<h1>Chapter 4 Summary</h1>
<h2>Mathematical Functions, Characters, and Strings</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Java provides the mathematical methods <span>sin</span>, <span>cos</span>, <span>tan</span>, <span>asin</span>, <span>acos</span>, <span>atan</span>, <span>toRadians</span>, <span>toDegree</span>, <span>exp</span>, <span>log</span>, <span>log10</span>, <span>pow</span>, <span>sqrt</span>, <span>ceil</span>, <span>floor</span>, <span>rint</span>, <span>round</span>, <span>min</span>, <span>max</span>, <span>abs</span>, and <span>random</span> in the <span>Math</span> class for performing mathematical functions.</li>
    <li>The character type <span>char</span> represents a single character.</li>
    <li>An <span>escape sequence</span> consists of a backslash (\) followed by a character or a combination of digits.</li>
    <li>The character <span>\</span> is called the <span>escape character</span>.</li>
    <li>The characters <span>' '</span>, <span>\t</span>, <span>\f</span>, <span>\r</span>, and <span>\n</span> are known as the <span>whitespace characters</span>.</li>
    <li>Characters can be compared based on their Unicode using the <span>relational operators</span>.</li>
    <li>The <span>Character</span> class contains the methods <span>isDigit</span>, <span>isLetter</span>, <span>isLetterOrDigit</span>, <span>isLowerCase</span>, and <span>isUpperCase</span> for testing whether a character is a digit, letter, lowercase, or uppercase. It also contains the <span>toLowerCase</span> and <span>toUpperCase</span> methods for returning a lowercase or uppercase letter.</li>
    <li>A <span>string</span> is a sequence of characters. A string value is enclosed in matching double quotes (<span>"</span>). A character value is enclosed in matching single quotes (<span>'</span>).</li>
    <li>Strings are objects in Java. A method that can only be invoked from a specific object is called an <span>instance method</span>. A non-instance method is called a <span>static method</span>, which can be invoked without using an object.</li>
    <li>You can get the length of a string by invoking its <span>length()</span> method, retrieve a character at the specified index in the string using the <span>charAt(index)</span> method, and use the <span>indexOf</span> and <span>lastIndexOf</span> methods to find a character or a substring in a string.</li>
    <li>You can use the <span>concat</span> method to concatenate two strings, or the plus (<span>+</span>) operator to concatenate two or more strings.</li>
    <li>You can use the <span>substring</span> method to obtain a substring from the string.</li>
    <li>You can use the <span>equals</span> and <span>compareTo</span> methods to compare strings. The <span>equals</span> method returns <span>true</span> if two strings are equal, and <span>false</span> if they are not equal. The <span>compareTo</span> method returns 0, a positive integer, or a negative integer, depending on whether one string is equal to, greater than, or less than the other string.</li>
    <li>The <span>printf</span> method can be used to display a formatted output using <span>format specifiers</span>.</li>
</ul>
